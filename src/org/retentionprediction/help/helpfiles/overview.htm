<h1>Retention Prediction Software Overview</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this software is to predict HPLC retention very accurately...</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="features1.htm">among different HPLC/UHPLC instruments</a></li>
<li><a href="features3.htm">with different gradients</a></li>
<li><a href="features3.htm">with different flow rates</a></li>
<li><a href="features2.htm">and with chemically diverse solutes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>...subject to the following constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>standard experimental conditions must be used (see below)</li>
<li>retention may only be predicted for compounds in the <a href="database.htm">retention database</a></li>
<li>the retention times of a set of standard solutes (what we call &quot;instrument calibration solutes&quot;) must be measured in the same run as the retention predictions are to be made.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>There are two key features of this retention
prediction system that distinguish it from others: 1) it makes use of an
<a href="database.htm">interpolated isocratic retention vs. solvent composition database</a> and 2) it
uses a novel &quot;back-calculation&quot; approach to precisely and easily
account for differences between HPLC instruments.</p>

<p><b>1) Interpolated isocratic retention vs. solvent
composition database</b></p>

<p>The heart of this retention prediction system
is a <a href="database.htm">database</a> containing isocratic retention vs. solvent composition
relationships of each solute. Data points are spaced closely together (at 10% B
intervals) and interpolated to precisely determine retention as a function of
solvent composition. This is absolutely critical for accurate
retention prediction under varying gradient and flow rate conditions (and to a
lesser degree, even between different HPLC instruments, see above).</p>

<p>In this
demonstration version of the retention prediction software, the <a href="database.htm">retention
database</a> holds data that was measured for 35 solutes. These 35 solutes were
specially selected for demonstration purposes because they represent all of the
5 types of interaction that control retention on reversed-phase alkylsilica columns.</p>

<p>Of course, the retention data in this
<a href="database.htm">database</a> is highly dependent on the specific stationary phase used, the
temperature of the column during the run, the mobile phase solvent A and B, the
mobile phase buffer, and the mobile phase pH. That's why we've defined a set of
standard conditions, which are the same as the conditions we used to measure
the isocratic retention data in our database. The standard conditions we used
for the existing database are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard stationary phase: Waters Acquity BEH C18 (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7&#956;m)</li>
<li>Standard column temperature: 35 °C</li>
<li>Standard solvent A: pH 2.80 30 mM ammonium formate buffer in water</li>
<li>Standard solvent B: 100% acetonitrile</li>
</ul>

<p>These standard conditions must be used in
order for the software to be able to accurately predict retention. However, in
the future, we plan to explore the use of other standard conditions that may further
improve retention prediction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>2) &quot;Back-calculation&quot; of gradient and flow rate profiles</b></p>

<p>Armed with the isocratic retention vs.
solvent composition database, you could theoretically predict gradient
retention on virtually any HPLC system under a range of gradient programs and
flow rates <i>so long as you know two additional important pieces of
information</i>:</p>

<p>1) The precise gradient profile (solvent
composition vs. time) <i>actually produced</i> by your HPLC </p>

<p>2) The precise flow rate profile (flow rate
vs. time) <i>actually produced</i> by your HPLC</p>

<p>Together, these profiles fully define the
output of the HPLC instrument (and therefore fully characterize differences
between HPLC instruments).</p>

<p>In our previous work, we attempted to
directly measure the gradient profile as accurately as possible for just this
purpose. Unfortunately, it was an extraordinarily tedious process and the profile was very difficult
to measure accurately. Nevertheless, we were able to significantly improve retention
prediction accuracy this way. But it was clear that the accuracy (or lack
of accuracy) in our profile measurements was limiting accuracy in our retention
predictions.</p>

<p>To circumvent this problem, we devised a
system in which the gradient and flow rate profiles aren't measured directly,
but instead are <i>back-calculated</i> from a) the gradient retention times of a set
of standard solutes (which we call the "gradient calibration solutes") and b) their isocratic retention vs. solvent composition relationships.
Since we provide the <a href="database.htm">isocratic retention vs. solvent composition relationships</a>,
the only pieces of information a user must provide are the retention
times of the gradient calibration solutes in their run. From those, effective gradient and
flow rate profiles may be back-calculated and used to accurately predict
retention of any other compound in the retention database. <i>In other words,
the user-supplied retention times of a set of standard compounds are used to back-calculate what the gradient and flow rate profiles <b>must have been</b>
to give those retention times.</i></p>

<p>The following figure shows a flow chart of
this retention prediction process:</p>

<h2>Before you use this tool</h2>

<p>This retention prediction tool is fully
functional, but in order for it to be at all useful to you, we need to expand
the <a href="database.htm">retention database</a>. Right now, it only contains 35 compounds. The 35
compounds fully represent all of the 5 types of interactions that control retention on
reversed-phase alkylsilica columns, making them a good set of solutes to test the system, but 
they aren't useful for any practical purpose because there are so few of them.</p>

<p>Assuming we had more compounds in the
database, which we plan to add soon, you would need to do the following before
you inject your sample:</p>

<p><b>1) Spike the sample with gradient calibration
solutes</b></p>

<p>The gradient calibration solutes must be
compounds with known retention vs. solvent composition relationships under our
standard conditions. In other words, they must be in the retention database.
There is nothing else special about the gradient calibration solutes except
that they must elute over a wide range of retention times and they should elute
over evenly-spaced intervals.</p>

<p>Of the 35 compounds in the <a href="database.htm">retention
database</a>, we chose 1) adenosine, 2) <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethylacetamide, 3) <i>p</i>-toluenesulfonic
acid, 4) <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-diethylacetamide, 5) indole-3-acetic acid, 6)
dimethyl phthalate, 7) indole, 8) diethyl phthalate, 9) diallyl phthalate, 10)
di-<i>n</i>-propyl phthalate, 11) di-<i>n</i>-butyl phthalate, 12) di-<i>n</i>-pentyl
phthalate, 13) di-<i>n</i>-hexyl phthalate, 14) di-<i>n</i>-heptyl phthalate,
and 15) di-<i>n</i>-octyl phthalate</p>

<p>We chose to use 15 compounds because they
allowed accurate back-calculation. If your gradient or flow profile has more
features to capture, it would be wise to use more calibration solutes. On the
other hand, if your gradient and flow profiles have less features to capture,
you could go with less, but the minimum number of gradient calibration solutes
allowed is 6.</p>

<p><b>2) Set up the standard chromatographic
conditions</b></p>

<p>In order for the retention vs. solvent
composition relationships in the <a href="database.htm">database</a> to be accurate, the standard
chromatographic conditions must be strictly adhered to:</p>

<p>a) You must use one of the standard columns
on which the database data was measured (right now there's only one).</p>

<p>b) Solvent A must be pH 2.80 30 mM ammonium
formate buffer in water and solvent B must be 100% acetonitrile</p>

<p>c) The column temperature must be kept at 35
°C</p>

<p>One big advantage of this retention
prediction system is that these standard conditions are relatively
unrestrictive. You may change the gradient program and flow rate however you like!</p>

<p>However, one note of caution about flow
rates:</p>

<p>The <a href="database.htm">isocratic retention data</a> was measured on the
standard column at a flow rate of 200 &#956;L/min. We tested the retention
prediction accuracy of the system at flow rates of 100 &#956;L/min, 200
&#956;L/min, and 400 &#956;L/min, and found virtually no difference in the
accuracy of retention predictions. Still, one could imagine that viscous
frictional heating caused by the mobile phase moving through the stationary phase could
significantly change the retention behavior of compounds. Therefore, changing
the flow rate more dramatically than we did could reduce retention prediction
accuracy, but that's still something that must be tested.</p>

<p>Once you've run your sample under the
standard conditions and determined the retention times of the gradient
calibration solutes, you can begin using this software to predict retention of
any other compound in the database.</p>
