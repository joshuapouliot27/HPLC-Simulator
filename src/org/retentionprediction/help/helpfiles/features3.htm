<h2>Predicting retention under a range of gradient and flow
rate conditions</h2>

<p>Other
retention prediction systems are only very accurate when the conditions used to
measure retention are rigorously reproduced. This leaves no (or at least very
little) room for method development. One huge advantage of this approach is
that you can accurately <i>and</i> easily predict the retention of compounds
under varying flow rate and gradient conditions. This leaves significant room
for method development.</p>
