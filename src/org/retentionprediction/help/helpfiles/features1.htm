<h2>Predicting retention accurately among different
HPLC/UHPLC instruments</h2>

<p>This may seem
like a trivial task, but the retention times you measure on one HPLC instrument
can be <i>very</i> different from those measured using a different HPLC instrument...<i>even
when using exactly the same column!</i></p>

<p>Fortunately the
instrument-dependent causes of these retention time shifts are well-known. They
result from the following differences between HPLC instruments:</p>

<p><b>a) Solvent
mis-proportioning </b></p>

<p>HPLC systems
are normally specified to deliver solvent proportioning to within 1% of the set
value - this is enough to cause <i>huge</i> changes in retention. For example,
if you consider a typical solute eluting at the end of a 20 min linear gradient
going from 10% B to 100% B, a 1% solvent proportioning error could account for
a difference of more than 0.48 min (2.4% of the gradient time).</p>

<p><b>b) Flow rate</b></p>

<p>The
theoretical flow rate error from water/acetonitrile gradients is up to 3%,
though experimental measurements have shown up to 8% error. There are many
sources for this error including non-zero volume of mixing, non-zero
compressibility, pressure-dependent viscosities, and others. During a gradient,
the flow rate vs. time profile can be quite different between different
instruments, particularly between pumps that employ high-pressure mixing vs.
those that employ low-pressure mixing.</p>

<p><b>c) Gradient
dispersion</p>

<p>Gradient
dispersion is characterized by &quot;rounding&quot; of the gradient profile at
points where the gradient slope changes (in a linear gradient, this would be at
the beginning and end of the gradient). At low flow rates, rounding can be <i>very</i>
pronounced and differs significantly between HPLC instruments.</p>

<p><b>d) Dwell time</b></p>

<p>Last, but
certainly not least, is the dwell time. This is the time it takes for the
programmed gradient to actually get to the column inlet. This delay depends on
how much volume is between the pump mixer and the column inlet - something that
is highly variable between HPLC instruments (though it can be controlled pretty
easily by making modifications to the instrument).</p>
