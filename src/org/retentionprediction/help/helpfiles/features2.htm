<h2>Predicting retention accurately with chemically diverse
solutes</h2>

<p>One of the
major difficulties in predicting the retention of chemically-diverse compounds
in gradient elution is that their retention dependence on solvent composition can
differ dramatically. For example, the following figure [insert figure here] shows the isocratic
retention behavior of three different compounds at a range of solvent
compositions. You clearly can't assume that the retention vs. solvent composition
relationships all have the same shape - you can't even assume that they're
linear.</p>

<p>However, many
other approaches at retention prediction like retention indexing and peak
alignment schemes like non-linear retention time warping assume that the
retention vs. solvent composition relationships all have the same general shape.
Because of this <i>very rough</i> assumption, these techniques cannot
accurately predict retention when the gradient program or flow rate is changed.
In fact, even the relatively small differences in the gradient and flow rate
profiles produced by different HPLC pumps are enough to significantly lower
retention prediction accuracy with these schemes.</p>

<p>To give an
idea of how big these errors can be, consider that the isocratic retention
index of aspirin was measured at 10% methanol to be 302. However, when the mobile
phase composition changed to 30%, <i>the retention index of aspirin dropped to
8!</i></p>

<p>We avoid this
problem by making no assumption about the retention vs. solvent composition
relationship of each solute. We measure the isocratic retention of each solute
at a range of solvent compositions and store that information in a retention
database that is used to calculate gradient retention times.</p>
