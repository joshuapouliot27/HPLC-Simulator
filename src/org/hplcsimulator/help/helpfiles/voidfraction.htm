	<h1>Void Fraction control</h1>
    <p>Enter a number in the text box to indicate the fraction of volume in the column that is occupied by mobile phase (as opposed to stationary phase).</p>
    <h4>Remarks</h4>
    <p>The void fraction includes the space between the spherical particles (packed randomly) as well as space in the porous particles that is accessible to the mobile phase. The void fraction is commonly around 0.6.</p>
