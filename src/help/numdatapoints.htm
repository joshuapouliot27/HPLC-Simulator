    <p>Enter an integer in the text box to set the number of points to be plotted in the chromatogram between the initial and final times.</p>
    <h4>Remarks</h4>
    <p>Data points are evenly spaced between the initial and final times, and the number of data points is determined by this control. If the simulator is running slowly, it may be beneficial to reduce the number of points plotted. On the other hand, if the chromatogram does not have a high enough density of data points to display the peaks clearly, it may be necessary to increase the number of data points.</p>
