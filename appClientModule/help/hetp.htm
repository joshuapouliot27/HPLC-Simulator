	<h1>HETP (Height Equivalent to a Theoretical Plate) indicator</h1>
    <p>Indicates the Height Equivalent to a Theoretical Plate (HETP) in cm.</p>
    <h4>Calculation</h4>
    <p><img src="images/hetpeq.jpg"></p>
    <p>where
    <br>
    <span class="symbol"><i>h</i></span> = reduced plate height (cm)
    <br>
    <span class="symbol"><i>d<sub>p</sub></i></span> = particle diameter (cm)
    </p>
    <h4>Remarks</h4>
    <p>
    	The HETP concept is adapted from chemical engineering and thus is a bit awkward here because modern HPLC is done in a continuous fashion rather than in discontinuous one, as is the case with literal plates in other applications.  We characterize the ‘efficiency’ of a chromatographic separation by calculating the ‘number of plates’ that a particular column exhibits under a particular set of circumstances.  The reduced plate height (<span class="symbol"><i>h</i></span>) is a more useful metric of the performance of the column because it takes into account the size of the particles packed into the column.
