	<h1>Reduced Plate Height indicator</h1>
    <p>Indicates the reduced plate height (<span class="symbol"><i>h</i></span>) of the separation. The reduced plate height is a dimensionless measure of the performance of a HPLC column under a particular set of conditions.  Here <span class="symbol"><i>h</i></span> is dimensionless because the HETP is normalized to the particle size (<span class="symbol"><i>d<sub>p</sub></i></span>), which allows for comparisons of the performance of columns packed with different particle sizes.  The reduced plate height is most commonly calculated using the van Deemter equation, which incorporates three empirically determined parameters, A, B, and C, that are characteristic of a particular type of packing material.</p>
    <h4>Calculation</h4>

    <p>where
    <br>
    <span class="symbol"><i>h</i></span> = reduced plate height
    <br>
    <span class="symbol"><i>&#957;</i></span> = reduced flow velocity 
    <br>
    <span class="symbol"><i>A</i></span> = reduced A parameter
    <br>
    <span class="symbol"><i>B</i></span> = reduced B parameter
    <br>
    <span class="symbol"><i>C</i></span> = reduced C parameter
    </p>
    <h4>Remarks</h4>
    <p>The reduced velocity <span class="symbol"><i>&#957;</i></span> is a very important number.  In physical terms, it represents the relative contributions of convection and diffusion to axial transport of the analyte through the column.  So, when <span class="symbol"><i>&#957;</i></span> = 1, convection and diffusion contribute equally to movement of the analyte through the column.  When <span class="symbol"><i>&#957;</i></span> &lt;&lt; 1, axial transport is dominated by diffusion, and when <span class="symbol"><i>&#957;</i></span> &gt;&gt; 1, axial transport is dominated by convection.</p>
