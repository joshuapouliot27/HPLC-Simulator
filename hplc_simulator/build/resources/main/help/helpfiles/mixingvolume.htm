	<h1>Mixing Volume control</h1>
    <p>Enter a number in the text box to indicate the amount of "mixing volume" (in uL) present before the column inlet.</p>
    <h4>Remarks</h4>
    <p>Usually, the majority of the mixing volume is in the pump itself and in the solvent mixer. This mixing volume is depicted in the diagram below:</p>

    <p>Consider a gradient in which the fraction of solvent B increases linearly over the course of the experiment. As eluent with a higher amount of solvent B enters the mixing volume, it mixes with eluent of a lower solvent B fraction. This causes the gradient profile reaching the column to be dispersed and delayed.</p>
    <p>The graph below shows an ideal gradient profile going from 0% B to 100% B in 5 min <i>without any mixing volume</i>.</p>

    <p>The graph below shows the same gradient profile distored from a large mixing volume.</p>
