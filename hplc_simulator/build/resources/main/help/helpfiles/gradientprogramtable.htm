	<h1>Gradient Program Table</h1>
    <p>The gradient program table displays the current gradient program and lets you change it. The table contains two columns: time (in min) and solvent B fraction. Therefore, each row in the table indicates the solvent B fraction that the HPLC pump should generate at the indicated time. Between those times, solvent B fraction is determined by linear interpolation.</p>
    <p>To change the gradient program, you can double-click any of the cells in the table to change them. To insert a row, select the row <i>before</i> the position you wish to insert it and click the "Insert Row" button. To delete a row, select the row and click the "Remove Row" button.
    </p>
    <h4>Remarks</h4>
    <p>The gradient profile actually produced by an HPLC instrument can be significantly different from the one you programmed. In real life, there are several causes for this. Here, the <a href="mixingvolume.htm">mixing volume</a> and <a href="nonmixingvolume.htm">non-mixing volume</a> simulate sources of gradient profile distortion.</p>
